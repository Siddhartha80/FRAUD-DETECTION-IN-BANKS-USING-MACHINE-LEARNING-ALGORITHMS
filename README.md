FRAUD DETECTION IN BANKS  USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS


Fraud detection in banks is a critical process aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent activities within the financial sector. Banks utilize various methods, including machine learning algorithms, manual reviews, and fraud alerts, to detect and mitigate fraud, such as credit card fraud, check fraud, and money laundering. A significant challenge in fraud detection is accurately identifying fraudulent activity without generating false positives, which can lead to unnecessary additional work for bank staff and inconvenience for customers. To address this, banks often employ a combination of automated and manual processes to confirm suspected fraud. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, plays a vital role in this context by analyzing data on customer transactions and account activity to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. Various machine learning algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and random forests, can be used for fraud detection. KNN and SVM are supervised learning algorithms that classify transactions based on patterns in labeled datasets. Decision trees identify patterns in transactions to predict fraud, while random forests, an ensemble of decision trees, enhance prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of multiple trees.
